Learning-Pacman
===============

For this project, we had to implement a controller for Pacman using a learning algorithm of our choice.  We chose to use a genetic algorithm and managed to get an AI starting with scores between 200 and 300 and learning the game to reach scores as high as 15.000 !  The report included along with the sources explain (in French) the steps we took and the analysis we derived from our test results to understand the final strategy of the learning AI in various situations.
